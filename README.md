# TimeLapseBuilder

This is a reference implementation for building time lapse videos from still images using Swift.

The sample app runs on iOS, but the `TimeLapseBuilder` class can be easily ported to run on macOS.

## Getting started

 1. Clone this repository
 1. Open `TimeLapseBuilder.xcodeproj` with Xcode
 1. Have a look at `ViewController.swift` and `TimeLapseBuilder.swift`
 1. If you provide some URLs in `ViewController.swift` and run the app in the simulator, it will build a video and play it.

If you need help adapting this code to use in your app, I recommend posting your questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). Please open an issue if you find a bug.

## Legacy Swift

Older versions of TimeLapseBuilder are available for Swift 1.2 and 2.0. Check out the `Legacy/` directory.
